Setting up ZoomPi

Got things from Amazon:
<list of things>

Assembled case per https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0S1eTqqshY
	- Attached fan to case lid, heatsinks, and mounted pi
	- Did not close lid yet, for the camera
Followed https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/raspberry-pi-getting-started/1
	- Put SD card in adapter and in laptop slot
	- Got Raspberry Pi Imager from: https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/
	- Installed imager
	- Ran imager
	- Top option, Raspbian, 2020-02-13
	- Chose SD card
	- Chose write
	- Ate dinner.... or not.
Turned on Pi for the first time
	- All settings as expected
	- Password: 
	- Chose not to handle black borders (I want to know how to change this setting later)
	- Download and install updates "failed" with weird message.
		- Remedy is apparently "sudo apt update"
- Checked version of Raspbian
	- cat /etc/os-release
	- numbers... text... 10 "buster"
	- great
Tested audio using onboard port - works!
Tested zoom using internet browser - works!
Setting up microphone and sound card
	- Disable onboard sound chip
		- go to /etc/modprobe.d/
		- F4 to open in terminal
		- sudo mousepad raspi-blacklist.conf 
		- add "blacklist snd_bcm2835"
	- Rebooted with sound card plugged in
	- The following is still in place; I can't figure out why audio doesn't work by default for zoom. Settings currently *have* to be switched [Note: I never figured this out; the next two lines are ? needed]
		- Terminal: sudo mousepad /usr/share/alsa/alsa.conf
			- Changed defaults.ctl.card "0" -> "1"
			- Changed defaults.pcm.card "0" -> "1"
	- Rt-click speaker, chose USB audio device - it works.
	- Test using speaker-test -Dhw1,0 -c2 -twav
    - Hi lady's voice!
	- Zoom works, but only when settings are changed back and forth. Also, many microphone settings are listed... not a fan of that.
Setting up camera
	- sudo raspi-config
<And the notes stopped here. Good job, Jim. I ran into technical difficulties, so I stopped taking notes. I fixed some. The rest of the following is from memory (read: unreliable).
  - A dialog should show up.
  - Choose "Interfacing Options"
  - Choose "P1 Camera"
  - Choose "Enable"
  - Reboot
  - Camera works!
Set up link on the desktop to go straight to meeting. Had to do Captchas every time :/

Case modifications
  - Used dremel and grinding wheel to cut hole in case above the camera port; camera line was bending. Need a longer camera cable anyways.
  - Drilled out the screw holes for the fan. Used rubber silent fan
