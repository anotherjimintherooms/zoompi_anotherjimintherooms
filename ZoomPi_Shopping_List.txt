Zoom Pi Shopping List

I'm some random joker putting this stuff together. I have no affiliation with either Zoom or Raspberry Pi, I simply use the products the same way I use Folger's coffee - to help get stuff done.

Rubber Fan Grommets (shave off a couple dB sound)
  - https://www.amazon.com/Noctua-NA-SAV3-Silicone-Anti-Vibration-mounts/dp/B071PFPFV2/
    - Tested, work. Expensive. The fan they came with was a bust, too much cabling and I don't have a soldering iron.
  - https://www.amazon.com/Cosmos-Pieces-Rubber-Mounting-Screws/dp/B00H9905KA/
    - Should also work


You will also need:
  - A display with an HDMI in
  - Headphones with a 3.5mm headphone jack (this is the common one)
  - Internet
  - Another computer with an SD card slot, for setting up the Raspberry Pi disk
